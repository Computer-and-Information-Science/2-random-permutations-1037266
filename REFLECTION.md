# Assignment 2 Reflection - Frank Sanchez

## Approach to the Problem
I approached the problem by taking a look at the array sized I was using for each algorithm.
I noticed the first alogorith used smaller array sizes than the rest which indicated longer running times.
As I proceeded to each algorithm I noticed the array size getting bigger and bigger. 
It helped narrow down the nature of each algorithm.

The website above helped me figure out what exactly in the function dictated the nature of the algorithm.
## Challenges Encountered
I still find writing code to be challenging.
I used tutors to help check my code.
I ran into an issue where my permutation was running *0 - (n-1)*. 
it kept giving me a *NOT AS EXPECTED* message which a tutor helped me fix.
## Conclusions
This assignment helped me realized to take a deeper look into analazying problems.
Algoritms can bottleneck your results.
Choosing the right algoritm is important.
